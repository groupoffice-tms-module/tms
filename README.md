# tms
Transportation Management System for Group-Office groupware and CRM

Project is hosted over at Sourceforge
https://sourceforge.net/projects/groupoffice-tms-module/

Initial Push

This is just the TMS module. It won't do to much on its own. Drop the folder named ' tms ' in to the modules folder on the  Group-Office CRM. 

Login as admin or what other account that has "modify" modules permissions and you should see the ' TMS ' module available.

Click the Radio button and then you should see it in the Start pull-down menu. 

This is Alpha and I REALLY mean Alpha so if your not a developer and you DON'T want to hose your GO system then don't install this. Absolutly not on a production system, yet.   I gave fair wanrning....

I always welcome pull request. Send some up and will absolutly give credit for cool code... Even if it's not we can make it kool together.

Happy hacking...
